So here goes my first post!

# 2021 Retrospective

"What did you accomplish in 2021?" 

A straightforward question that really ashamed me. I spend way too much time on social media, entertainment, youtubes, random videos promoted by algorithms..etc. Back in early 2021, I've made a goal list on things to achieve before the end of 2021. One of them is definitely setting up a personal blogging a.k.a portfolio site but my first post here is really summarizing how unproductive my 2021 goes. Thinking about how much time I wasted in 2021 and how much knowledge and practical gap that I needed to fill to become a Machine Learning engineer could be frustrating. However, instead of tangling up in things that could not be undone, reflecting on past mistakes and learning to build on the mistakes is practically more helpful. Here I adopted the concept of Scrum framework to develop a personal "Sprint Retrospective" to conclude my 2021.

### What went well?
* Completed my Final Year Project
* Found internship of my interest
* Pioneer in my department to develop a deep learning function on NLP tasks in one of the projects.
* Study about transformers in theory.

### What went wrong?
* Poor time management
* Easily distract from social media (youtube included)
* Imbalance between internship and personal project time
* "Perfection" syndrome (Trying to find the best resources to learn something but ended up wasting more time)
* Laziness

# 2022 Expectations

Now, I am also eagerly looking forward to 2022. 2021 could have been much better, but it is what it is. I am still on my way to become a version of myself. Especially, turning those frustration and negativity from 2021 into the driving force for motivation really excites me to see how far I will go in 2022.
